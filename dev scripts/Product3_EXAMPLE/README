Product3_EXAMPLE project
========================

This project contains a set of example models that are compatible with Product 3.

Each of these models has at least been executed using NONMEM, apart from the
Nock_2013_Carboplatin_PK_MONOLIX2 model which has been execute using NONMEM, Monolix
and PsN.

The NONMEM executions also included a check of the resulting estimates and some rudimentary
GOF plots were produced and analysed.

The provided data sets are just small and simulated and are useful for test purposes.
